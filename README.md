# IOT Weather Sensor

The project is an internet connected device that communicates weather activity to a light source.

## Summary

This project deals with weather conditions and being prepared for the weather. I wanted to create an ambient IoT device that allowed people to engage with the information by simply glancing. The idea is to disconnect from reliance on devices and leave the house confident that you are wearing the correct layers of clothing for the day ahead.

## Component Parts

I will build my project with a Neopixel LED (Rainbow Matrix) build into a structure and a Particle Photon as a end goal option. However, If this proves to be problematic, I will use a temperature/humidity sensor as the input and to an arduino and the same LED and structure as the output.

## Challenges

The most challenging aspect is assigning each event (temperature change / rain) with a color and state change of the LED. Since I've never worked an rainbow matrix or this level of intricacy, it will take some time.

## Timeline


- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Start to write the code for the input / IFTTT and Particle.
- Week 3: Start to write the code for the input / IFTTT and Particle. Write the code for the rainbow matrix.
- Week 4: Compile all elements into the structure. And test. Test. Test.
- Week 5: Present!
